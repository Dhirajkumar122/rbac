Project Name
    A brief description of your project and its key features.

Project Setup Guide
    This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js
npm: Comes bundled with Node.js
SQL Server: Download and install SQL Server
Setup Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
3. Initialize the Project
Generate a package.json file with default values:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
4. Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies listed in the package.json file:

bash
Copy code
npm install
5. Set Up the SQL Database
Start SQL Server: Ensure your SQL Server instance is running.
Create a Database: Use your preferred SQL client to create a new database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
Configure Database Connection: Update the .env file with your database credentials (details below).
6. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

env
Copy code
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_USER=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_HOST=your-database-host
Replace the placeholders (your-secret-key, your-database-name, etc.) with your actual values.

7. Start the Application
Launch the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application should now be running on the specified port (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Enhancements
While the application is functional, here are some areas for improvement:

Authentication: Implement a robust authentication system to verify user identities.
Authorization: Set up role-based access control for managing user permissions.
Security: Add measures to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
